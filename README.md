### Quick Installation

**Note:** Only Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone this repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine && cd rengine
    ```

1. Edit the dotenv file, **please make sure to change the password for postgresql `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`!**

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

1. In the dotenv file, you may also modify the Scaling Configurations

    ```bash
    MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
    MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
    ```

    MAX_CONCURRENCY: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.

    MIN_CONCURRENCY: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

    These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity

1. Run the installation script, Please keep an eye for any prompt, you will also be asked for username and password for reNgine.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

* Maybe nominate me for [GitHub Stars?](https://stars.github.com/nominate/)
* Join DigitalOcean using my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/e353502d19fc) your profit is **$100** and I get $25 DO credit. This will help me test reNgine on VPS before I release any major features.

It takes a considerable amount of time to add new features and make sure everything works. Donating is your way of saying: **reNgine is awesome**.

Any support is greatly appreciated! Thank you!

### reNgine Bug Bounty Program

[![huntr](https://cdn.huntr.dev/huntr_security_badge_mono.svg)](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyogeshojha%2Frengine)

Security researchers, welcome aboard! I'm excited to announce the reNgine bug bounty programme in collaboration with [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev), which means that you will be rewarded for any vulnerabilities you find in reNgine.

Thank you for your interest in reporting reNgine vulnerabilities! If you are aware of any potential security vulnerabilities in reNgine, we encourage you to report them immediately via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyogeshojha%2Frengine).

**Please do not disclose vulnerabilities via Github issues/blogs/tweets after/before reporting to huntr.dev as this is explicitly against the disclosure policy of huntr.dev and reNgine and will not be considered for monetary rewards.**

Please note that the reNgine maintainer does not set the bounty amount.
The bounty reward is determined by an industry-first equation developed by huntr.dev to understand the popularity, impact and value of repositories to the open-source community.

**What do I expect from security researchers?**

* Patience: Please note that I am currently the only maintainer in reNgine and it will take some time to validate your report. I ask for your patience during this process.
* Respect for privacy and security reports: Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities (including GitHub issues) before or after reporting them on huntr.dev! This is against the disclosure policy and will not be rewarded.
* Respect the rules

**What do you get in return?**

* Thanks from the maintainer
* Monetary rewards
* CVE ID(s)

Please find the [FAQ](https://www.huntr.dev/faq) and [Responsible disclosure policy](https://www.huntr.dev/policy/) from huntr.dev.
