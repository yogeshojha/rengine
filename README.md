### Quick Installation

**Note:** Only Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone this repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine && cd rengine
    ```

1. Edit the `.env` file, **please make sure to change the password for postgresql `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`!**

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

1. **Optional, only for non-interactive install**: In the `.env` file, **please make sure to change the super admin values!**

    ```bash
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=yourUsername
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=YourMail@example.com
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
    ```
    If you need to carry out a non-interactive installation, you can setup the login, email and password of the web interface admin directly from the .env file (instead of manually setting them from prompts during the installation process). This option can be interesting for automated installation (via ansible, vagrant, etc.).

    `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`: web interface admin username (used to login to the web interface).

    `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`: web interface admin email.

    `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: web interface admin password (used to login to the web interface).

1. In the dotenv file, you may also modify the Scaling Configurations

    ```bash
    MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
    MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
    ```

    `MAX_CONCURRENCY`: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.

    `MIN_CONCURRENCY`: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

    These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity.

    Here is the ideal value for `MIN_CONCURRENCY` and `MAX_CONCURRENCY` depending on the number of RAM your machine has:

    * 4GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=10`
    * 8GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=30`
    * 16GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=50`

    This is just an ideal value which developers have tested and tried out and works! But feel free to play around with the values.
    Maximum number of scans is determined by various factors, your network bandwidth, RAM, number of CPUs available. etc

1. Run the installation script, Please keep an eye for any prompt, you will also be asked for username and password for reNgine.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

    Or for a non-interactive installation, use `-n` argument (make sure you've modified the `.env` file before launching the installation).

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh -n
    ```

    If `install.sh` does not have install permission, please change it, `chmod +x install.sh`

**reNgine can now be accessed from <https://127.0.0.1> or if you're on the VPS <https://your_vps_ip_address>**

**Unless you are on development branch, please do not access reNgine via any ports**

### Installation (Mac/Windows/Other)

Installation instructions can be found at [https://reNgine.wiki/install/detailed/](https://reNgine.wiki/install/detailed/)

### Updating

1. Updating is as simple as running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd rengine &&  sudo ./update.sh
    ```

    If `update.sh` does not have execution permissions, please change it, `sudo chmod +x update.sh`

    **NOTE:** if you're updating from 1.3.6, and you're getting a 'password authentication failed' error, consider uninstalling 1.3.6 first, then install 2.x.x as you'd normally do.

### Submitting issues

You can submit issues related to this project, but you should do it in a way that helps developers to resolve it as quickly as possible.

For that, you need to add as much valuable information as possible.

You can have this valuable information by following these steps:

- Go to the root of the git cloned project
- Edit `web/entrypoint.sh` and add `export DEBUG=1` at the top
This should give you this result

  ```python
  #!/bin/bash

  export DEBUG=1

  python3 manage.py migrate
  python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

  exec "$@"
  ```
- Restart the web container: `docker-compose restart web`
- To deactivate, set **DEBUG** to **0** and restart the web container again

Then, with **DEBUG** set to **1**, in the `make logs` output you could see the full stack trace to debug reNgine.

Example with the tool arsenal version check API bug.

```
web_1          |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/celery/app/task.py", line 411, in __call__
web_1          |     return self.run(*args, **kwargs)
web_1          | TypeError: run_command() got an unexpected keyword argument 'echo'
```
Now you know the real error is `TypeError: run_command() got an unexpected keyword argument 'echo'`

And you can post the full stack trace to your newly created issue to help developers to track the root cause of the bug and correct the bug easily

**Activating debug like this also give you the full stack trace in the browser** instead of an error 500 without any details.
So don't forget to open the developer console and check for any XHR request with error 500.
If there's any, check the response of this request to get your detailed error.

### Support and Sponsoring

Over the past few years, I have been working hard on reNgine to add new features with the sole aim of making it the de facto standard for reconnaissance. I spend most of my free time and weekends working on reNgine. I do this in addition to my day job. I am happy to have received such overwhelming support from the community. To keep this project alive, you may

* Add a [GitHub Star](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine) to the project.
* Tweet about this project, or maybe blogs?
* Maybe nominate me for [GitHub Stars?](https://stars.github.com/nominate/)
* Join DigitalOcean using my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/e353502d19fc) your profit is **$100** and I get $25 DO credit. This will help me test reNgine on VPS before I release any major features.

It takes a considerable amount of time to add new features and make sure everything works. Donating is your way of saying: **reNgine is awesome**.

Any support is greatly appreciated! Thank you!
