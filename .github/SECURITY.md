Security Researchers, welcome onboard! I am excited to announce bug bounty program for reNgine in collaboration with [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev), this means you'll be rewarded for any security vulnerabilities discovered in reNgine.

Thank you for your interest in reporting vulnerabilities to reNgine! If you are aware of potential security vulnerabilities within reNgine, we encourage you to report immediately via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyogeshojha%2Frengine)

**Please do not disclose any vulnerabilities via Github Issues/Blogs/Tweets after/before reporting on huntr.dev as it is explicitly against huntr.dev and reNgine disclosure policy and will not be eligible for monetary rewards.**

Please note that the maintainer of reNgine does not determine the bounty amount.
The bounty reward is determined by industry-first equation from huntr.dev to understand the popularity, impact and value of repositories to the open source community.

**What do we expect from security researchers?**
